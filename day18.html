       <p id="n1"> In the early 20th century, Eugène Paul Louis Schueller (1881–1957),
        a young French chemist, developed a hair dye formula called Oréale. Schueller formulated and manufactured his own products, 
        which he sold to Parisian hairdressers.[5][6] On 31 July 1909, Schueller registered his company,[7] 
        the Société Française de Teintures Inoffensives pour Cheveux (Safe Hair Dye Company of France). The company eventually became L'Oréal. In 1920, 
        the company employed three chemists; the number of employees continued to grow with 100 by the year 1950, and 1,000 by the year 1984; as recently as 2021, 
        there was an estimated total of 85,252 worldwide.[8]</p>
        
        <p id="n2">L'Oréal got its start in the hair-color business, but the company soon branched out into other cleansing and beauty products.
             As of 2020, L'Oréal markets in all sectors of the beauty business: hair color, permanents, hair styling, body and skincare, cleansers, makeup, and fragrance. 
             The company's products are found in a wide variety of outlets, from hair salons and perfumeries to supermarkets, health/beauty outlets, pharmacies, and direct mail.[5][6]</p>
